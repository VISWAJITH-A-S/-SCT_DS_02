Task 02: Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

In this task, we performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset obtained from Kaggle. The primary objective was to understand the structure and quality of the data, handle missing values, and analyze the relationships between different variables such as age, gender, passenger class, and survival status. We visualized distributions using plots like histograms, bar charts, and box plots, and identified key patterns and trends, such as survival rates across different demographics. This task helped in deriving meaningful insights and preparing the data for further predictive modeling or statistical analysis.
